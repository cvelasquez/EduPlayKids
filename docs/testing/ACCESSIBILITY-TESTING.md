# Accessibility Testing - EduPlayKids

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive accessibility testing protocols for EduPlayKids, ensuring full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards while addressing the unique accessibility needs of children aged 3-8 years. The framework emphasizes inclusive design that supports children with diverse abilities and learning differences.

## Accessibility Standards and Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Framework

**Core Principles Application for Children:**

**1. Perceivable**
- Information and UI components must be presentable in ways children can perceive
- Extra emphasis on visual clarity and cognitive load reduction
- Support for multiple sensory channels (visual, auditory, tactile)

**2. Operable**
- Interface components and navigation must be operable by children with limited motor skills
- Generous touch targets and simplified interaction patterns
- Support for assistive technologies commonly used by children

**3. Understandable**
- Information and UI operation must be understandable to developing minds
- Age-appropriate language and clear, consistent navigation
- Predictable functionality across all activities

**4. Robust**
- Content must be robust enough to work with various assistive technologies
- Compatible with screen readers, switch devices, and eye-tracking systems
- Future-proof design for emerging accessibility technologies

### Child-Specific Accessibility Requirements

**Motor Skills Accommodations:**
- **Touch Target Size**: Minimum 60dp (iOS 44pt equivalent) for all interactive elements
- **Touch Target Spacing**: Minimum 8dp spacing between adjacent targets
- **Gesture Simplification**: Single-tap interactions preferred over complex gestures
- **Accidental Activation Prevention**: Confirmation for destructive or navigation actions
- **Alternative Input Support**: Switch control, voice control, eye-tracking compatibility

**Cognitive Accommodations:**
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Simple, clear interfaces with minimal distractions
- **Consistent Navigation**: Predictable layout and interaction patterns
- **Memory Support**: Visual cues and breadcrumbs for complex tasks
- **Attention Management**: Focus indicators and guided task completion
- **Processing Time**: Adequate time for children to process information and respond

**Sensory Accommodations:**
- **Visual**: High contrast ratios, scalable text, reduced motion options
- **Auditory**: Visual alternatives for audio content, adjustable volume controls
- **Vestibular**: Motion sensitivity options for animations and transitions
- **Tactile**: Haptic feedback support where appropriate

## Visual Accessibility Testing

### Color and Contrast Requirements

**Enhanced Contrast Standards for Children:**
```yaml
Contrast Requirements:
  Normal Text: 7:1 (enhanced from standard 4.5:1)
  Large Text: 4.5:1 (enhanced from standard 3:1)
  UI Components: 4.5:1 minimum
  Graphical Objects: 3:1 minimum

Color Usage Guidelines:
  - Never use color alone to convey information
  - Provide multiple visual cues (color + shape + icon)
  - Support colorblind children with pattern/texture alternatives
  - High contrast mode support for low vision
```

**Color Accessibility Testing Protocol:**
```yaml
Testing Tools:
  - Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)
  - WebAIM Contrast Checker
  - Android Accessibility Scanner
  - iOS Accessibility Inspector

Test Cases:
  □ All text meets 7:1 contrast ratio
  □ Interactive elements meet 4.5:1 contrast
  □ Focus indicators visible against all backgrounds
  □ Color-only information has alternative indicators
  □ High contrast mode maintains usability
  □ Colorblind simulation testing completed
```

### Typography and Readability

**Child-Friendly Typography Standards:**
- **Font Family**: Nunito (dyslexia-friendly characteristics)
- **Minimum Size**: 16sp for body text, 20sp for headings
- **Line Height**: 1.5x font size minimum for improved readability
- **Character Spacing**: Normal to wide spacing for emerging readers
- **Font Weight**: Medium weight preferred over light for better visibility

**Text Scaling Support:**
```yaml
Accessibility Text Scaling:
  Default: 100% (16sp base)
  Large: 125% (20sp)
  Extra Large: 150% (24sp)
  Maximum: 200% (32sp)

Requirements:
  - All text remains readable at 200% scaling
  - Layout adapts without horizontal scrolling
  - Touch targets maintain minimum size
  - No text truncation or overlap
```

### Visual Motion and Animation

**Motion Accessibility Controls:**
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Honor system-level motion preferences

  Hit Area: Extends beyond visual element if necessary

Special Considerations:
  - Larger targets for younger children (3-4 years)
