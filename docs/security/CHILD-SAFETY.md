**Safety Benefits of Offline Architecture:**
```csharp
public class OfflineSafetyManager
{
    // Ensures no external connections during gameplay
    public bool IsConnectionAllowed()
    {
        // Only allow connections for:
        // - Initial app download
        // - Critical security updates
        // - Parent-controlled premium upgrade
        return CurrentContext.IsParentControlled &&
               CurrentOperation.IsSecurityCritical;
    }

    public void EnforceOfflineMode()
    {
        // Disable all network capabilities during child use
        NetworkManager.DisableAllConnections();
        BrowserComponent.Disable();

    }
}
```

        _sessionStartTime = DateTime.Now;

        // Lock all parental functions
        SettingsAccess.Lock();
        PurchaseCapability.Disable();
        ExternalAccess.Block();

        // Enable child safety monitoring
        SafetyMonitor.StartSession();
    }

    public bool RequiresParentalAuthentication(UserAction action)
    {
        return action.IsParentalAction ||
               action.AccessesSensitiveData ||

        {
            SuggestBreak();
            OfferEasierActivity();
            ProvidePeacekeepingActivity();
        }
    }

    private bool DetectFrustrationPattern()
    {
        return ConsecutiveErrors > 3 ||
